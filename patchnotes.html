                            characters

                        <li>Fatal Error Rework (ETR: ?? again, probably when new UV part is out that has fatal error)

                    There is more that we will not publicly share for now as to have our secrets, but this is a general
                    idea of some of the things we have planned now that the Error Update is out. Also, please do not ask
                    for reworks, we will rework things as we see fit and as we deem necessary. Additionally, after the
                    PvP Capture Points, Arenas, UI Revamp, and PvE Revamp (so, likely next year) we will be fully
                    focusing on just content using the expanded gameplay of these reworks, these will include Bosses,
                    Characters, and Maps.



                    We appreciate your patience on these features and I (Noblus) will continue to update the game weekly
                    with characters and maps until these features are added. I understand that the major things the game
                    needs to elevate it might take longer than you all were expecting, but just know that the game will
                    continue to update regardless and we hope you enjoy UTA and its journey.
